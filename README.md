# theMightyCalculator
This my web based calculator project to calculate basic operations.<br>
### Topics I Learned <br>
1. ```eval()``` to Evaluate a string ```eval('2+2')```=```4```
2. ```Number.isInteger(input)``` to see is the number a Integer
3. ```isNaN(input)``` to see the input is blank or not
